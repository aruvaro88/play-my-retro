# Play My Retro

Play my retro is a webapp made as a third project of my Web Development bootcamp at Ironhack.

## Description

Play my retro is a social network where users can make events in a determinated place in order to meet people and play videogames with them. It is retrogaming oriented, but in a future, events could be with any console.

## What can I do there?

As a registered user you can create events, modify and remove it. Also you can comment other user events. As a social network, users can follow others to keep in touch with them.

## Live demo

If you want, you can check the app [here](https://play-my-retro.herokuapp.com/)
There are some default registered users you can use to test, but you can sign up to do it.

```
Users: aru, varo, almu, dena, fer, nando
password: admin
```

## Version
I consider this version of Play my retro fully functional, as a student project. I want to improve it with some features in order to become better product and usable.
